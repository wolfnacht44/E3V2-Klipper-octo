# E3V2-Klipper-octo
Personal Klipper Configuration utilizing a BTT Octopus 1.1 Mainboard

Just a simple backup Repo for my personal Klipper configuration, however, I figured there may be some useful information, macros, or configs, for anyone who may need them, or is seeking out particular information. This is specific to my configuration, and may not be suitable for everyone, these configs will change as my needs change, however, I will archive/comment out depricated items as they may be useful to someone else.

Please feel free to use and modify these to suit your own needs!
